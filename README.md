# Group 309 - The Quality of Air in New York

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

It is good to stay informed in certain topics, especially one like climate change. This data can reinforce the fact that our planet cannot sustain our current level of emissions and people are beginning to suffer because of our carelessness. I have a vested interest in climate change, particularly in the technologies that are more 'green' such as solar power (I did some collaborative work with Roost Solar on their User Application which tracked Solar Production which really kickstarted my interest) among other such things. While I am most certainly not the most active person who cares about climate change (I don't attend climate protests on the regular, for example) I try my best to stay on top of and understand new developments in that field. I chose to use this dataset as the US is close to my home in Canada. Anything that gravely affects them will likely hit us in the coming months or years.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was provided by the City of New York at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-ef520
It contains a variety of measurements relating to air quality in the state of New York. The table contains 2770 entries which are organized by measurements of, Air Toxin concentration, Deaths related to air quality (Split by age), Cardiovascular hospitalizations and Asthma ED visits. All of these categorizations are also catalogued by year. This dataset was first published in October of 2014 and has been consistently maintained up to this year, with its most recent updated on February 8 of 2020. The purpose of this dataset's existence is related to health, allowing a visitor to clearly see how the pollution in the state of New York is changing. Curiously, the Measure column is split oddly in how it shows how certain items (like toxin concentration) are measured, often being split into more than one column. ('Average Concentration' in one row and 'Per Km2' in another).
