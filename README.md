**Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words**

It is good to stay informed in certain topics, especially one like climate change. This data can reinforce the fact that our planet cannot sustain our current level of emissions and people are beginning to suffer because of our carelessness. I have a vested interest in climate change, particularly in the technologies that are more 'green' such as solar power (I did some collaborative work with Roost Solar on their User Application which tracked Solar Production which really kickstarted my interest) among other such things. While I am most certainly not the most active person who cares about climate change (I don't attend climate protests on the regular, for example) I try my best to stay on top of and understand new developments in that field. I chose to use this dataset due to its ease of access and that I have slight familiarity with Italy due to a trip there in 2017.

**Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words**

This dataset was provided by Saverio De Vito at the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA). The dataset was obtained at the following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)
Gathered using a single sensor set up in a relatively polluted area, this dataset contains a variety of measurements relating to air quality in an unnamed Italian city. The table contains 9358 entries which contain information such as the date and time, temperature and a wide variety of concentration measurements of the particles detecting in the air. The dataset notes that it contains missing values, which will are denoted with a value of -200. This dataset was first published on the associated website in March of 2016 and contains data gathered from March 2004 to February 2005. While the dataset is not as applicable to today's world due to its age, it can still provide useful insight on how air quality can change rapidly and the types of particles we end up breathing when exposed to low quality air.
